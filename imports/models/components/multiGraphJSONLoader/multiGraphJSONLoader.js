/**
 * This class loads and parses JSON files for multilayer network. The JSON files should be of form:
 * {nodes:[list of nodes], networks:[list of adjacency matricies]}
 * At a minimum, each node data packet must contain an "index" variable, which is an integer that describes the row/col
 * location associated with that node in the adjacency matricies. An example of a node data packet would look like this:
 * {"index":1, "label":"some label", "interesting dictionary":{}}. For the networks variable, each network should be an
 * array of arrays, with 1 and 0 representing a link and the absence of a link between the ith and jth nodes, respectiv-
 * ely (recalling that the ith node would have its "index" value equal to i, as would be the case for the jth node).
 * This object will then return a MultiGraph object, which will have the features available to slice and dice the
 * networks as desired!
